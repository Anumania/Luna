# Luna
A clean room implementation of the GameMaker runtime in C#

# Features
- Parses the GameMaker IFF file and allows you to invoke individual scripts

# Why?
Nothing like this really exists. I don't want to make this to be some sort of super performant crazy alternative to the base GameMaker runner, instead I think it'd be cool to implement improved/new features the base Runner doesn't have. Long term I'd like to have Luna running most GM games (unlikely). Maybe I could add some sort of scripting implementation to allow for modding games at runtime. Who knows! This is mostly just a fun project for learning how stuff works. Do I know what I'm doing? Not really!
