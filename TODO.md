Here's just a small list of things that I wanna do, so stuff works properly!
___
- push instruction machine broke (LArgumentType.Variable seems to be wrong)
- implement a special Luna value class instead of using `dynamic`
- make `Interpreter` class have a stack and variable list that can be used for different scopes, i guess? ie: support `with` statement
